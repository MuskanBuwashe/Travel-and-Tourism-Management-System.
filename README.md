# Travel-and-Tourism-Management-System.
This is a comprehensive Java-based  desktop application designed to streamline the process of managing travel and tourism activities. This system help individual users looking to plan and manage their travel plans efficiently. The application offers a user-friendly interface  to enhance the overall travel management experience.
GitHub facilitates collaborative development by providing tools for code
review, commenting, and discussion on changes.<br>

Pull Requests: Pull requests (PRs) are proposals for changes to a repository. They allow
developers to submit their changes for review, discuss the changes, andcollaboratively
improve the code before merging it into the main codebase.

Title: Implement GitHub Operations using Git.
Objective:
The objective of this experiment is to guide you through the process of using Git commands to interact
with GitHub, from cloning a repository to collaborating with others through pull requests.
Introduction:
GitHub is a web-based platform that offers version control and collaboration services for software
development projects. It provides a way for developers to work together, manage code, track changes,
and collaborate on projects efficiently. GitHub is built on top of the Git version controlsystem, which
allows for distributed and decentralised development.
Key Features of GitHub:
● Version Control: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes to
source code over time. This allows developers to collaborate on projects while maintaining a
history of changes and versions.
● Repositories: A repository (or repo) is a collection of files, folders, and the entire history of a
project. Repositories on GitHub serve as the central place where code and project-related
assets are stored.
● Collaboration: GitHub provides tools for team collaboration. Developers can work together
on the same project, propose changes, review code, and discuss issues within the context of
the project.
● Pull Requests: Pull requests (PRs) are proposals for changes to a repository. They allow
developers to submit their changes for review, discuss the changes, andcollaboratively
improve the code before merging it into the main codebase.
● Issues and Projects: GitHub allows users to track and manage project-related issues,
enhancements, and bugs. Projects and boards help organize tasks, track progress, and manage
workflows.
● Forks and Clones: Developers can create copies (forks) of repositories to work on their own
versions of a project. Cloning a repository allows developers to create a local copy of the
project on their machine.
● Branching and Merging: GitHub supports branching, where developers can create separate
lines of development for features or bug fixes. Changes made in branches can be merged back
into the main codebase.
● Actions and Workflows: GitHub Actions enable developers to automate workflows, such as
building, testing, and deploying applications, based on triggers like code pushes or pull
requests.
● GitHub Pages: This feature allows users to publish web content directly from a GitHub
repository, making it easy to create websites and documentation for projects.
Benefits of Using GitHub:
● Collaboration: GitHub facilitates collaborative development by providing tools for code
review, commenting, and discussion on changes.
● Version Control: Git's version control features help track changes, revert to previous
versions, and manage different branches of development.

● Open Source: GitHub is widely used for hosting open-source projects, making it easier for
developers to contribute and for users to find and use software.
● Community Engagement: GitHub fosters a community around projects, enabling interaction
between project maintainers and contributors.
● Code Quality: The code review process on GitHub helps maintain code quality and
encourages best practices.
● Documentation: GitHub provides a platform to host project documentation and wikis,
making it easier to document codebases and project processes.
● Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitHub Actions allows for
automating testing, building, and deploying applications, streamlining the development
process.
